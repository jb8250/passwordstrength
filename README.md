<h1>Password Strength Checker</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This Python script defines a function is_strong_password() that checks various criteria for password strength, including length, lowercase and uppercase letters, digits, and special characters. The main() function takes user input for a password and then calls is_strong_password() to determine if the password is strong or weak.


You can customize the strength criteria or add more checks based on your specific requirements. Additionally, you can enhance the user interface, provide recommendations for improving weak passwords, and integrate this tool into a larger application if desired.
